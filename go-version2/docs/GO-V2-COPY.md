## Section 2: THE CHALLENGE (replaces "The Problem")

```
Sound familiar?

Started strong, then stopped by week three.

Set ambitious goals but lost momentum halfway.

Tried apps, planners, accountability partners — nothing stuck.

You've done this loop before. Start, stumble, start over.

What if the problem isn't willpower — it's the system?

ConsistencyForge gives you a system that works.
```

## Section 3: HOW IT WORKS (kept, minor softening)

**Label:** How it works
**Title:** Three steps. Real results.

**Step 1: Sign Your Contract**
Choose the habit. Set the terms. Sign your name. This isn't a notification you'll swipe away — it's a real commitment to your future self, backed by your word.

**Step 2: One Click or Reply. Every Day.**
We send a daily email. Click "I did it" — or just reply. Your reply becomes a journal entry on the check-in. No separate app. No login. Optional WhatsApp reminders before your deadline. The simplest accountability system that exists.

**Step 3: Rise in Rank**
Streaks compound. Ranks climb. From "Spark" to "Inferno" — your consistency writes your title. Every day you show up, the commitment gets stronger.

## Section 4: THE COMMITMENT (replaces "The Dare")

**Label:** The commitment
**Title:** Put Your Commitment Where It Counts

```
A promise to yourself means more when something is at stake.

That's why ConsistencyForge lets you add a commitment accelerator —
a financial stake that keeps your daily contract meaningful.

Research shows people who commit financially are 2× more likely
to follow through on their goals.
```

**Stat counter:**
ConsistencyForge users have committed: $28,391+
...to becoming the people they've always wanted to be.

## Section 5: FEATURES (benefit-focused rewrite)

**Label:** Features
**Title:** Everything you need to stay consistent.

**1. Flexible Schedules**
Daily, weekdays, or custom schedules. Your contract adapts to your life so consistency stays realistic — not rigid.

**2. Click or Reply Check-Ins**
One email. Click or reply — both confirm your check-in. Replies become journal notes. Add WhatsApp reminders for an extra nudge. Zero friction.

**3. Optional Commitment Stakes**
Put $5 or $500 on the line — your choice. Adding financial commitment gives your contract real weight and keeps you motivated.

**4. Group Contracts**
Forge pacts with friends, teams, or accountability partners. Shared commitment. Shared progress. When the group shows up together, everyone wins.

**5. 20 Rank Themes**
Military. Mythological. Samurai. Viking. Your streak earns your title. Rise from "Spark" to "Inferno" — each theme tells a different story.

**6. 14 Visual Themes**
Dark mode. Fire mode. Obsidian. Ember. Make your dashboard look as sharp as your discipline feels.

## Section 10: FAQ

**Label:** FAQ
**Title:** Common Questions

1. **What happens to my money if I stake?**
Your stake is a commitment accelerator. Complete your contract — you win, because you became the person who keeps promises. If you miss check-ins, the forfeited amount covers the cost of running the accountability platform. We keep the system running so you have a place to show up every day.

2. **What if I miss a day?**
You lose that day's portion of your stake (if staked). The system is designed so that each day matters. Get back on track — your streak rebuilds with every check-in.

3. **Can I change my contract?**
Yes. Life changes, and your contract can adapt. Adjust terms as you grow. For an extra challenge, enable Ironclad Mode — it locks your contract permanently with no edits allowed.

4. **Is this just another habit app?**
ConsistencyForge is a commitment platform, not a habit tracker. The difference: your commitment is backed by a real contract, optional financial stakes, and a rank system that rewards consistency.

5. **Do I really need to pay?**
No. The platform is 100% free with no limitations. Financial stakes are completely optional — they're available for those who find that commitment works better with something at stake.

6. **What if I want to quit early?**
You can exit anytime. If staked, remaining stakes are forfeited. There are no refunds on broken commitments — accountability is the product.

7. **How does the email reply feature work?**
Reply to your daily check-in email — your reply text becomes a journal comment attached to that check-in. Use it to note what you did, track your progress, or capture how you felt. It's completely optional — you can also just click the link.

8. **How is this different from other accountability tools?**
Simplicity. One contract. One daily email. Click or reply. No apps to install, no graphs, no goal-setting wizards, no 14-step onboarding. Plus optional WhatsApp reminders and Ironclad Mode for zero escape hatches.
