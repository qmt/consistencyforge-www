## SECTION 1: HERO -- "The Slap"

### Headline

**STOP LYING TO YOURSELF.**

### Subheadline

You will sign the contract. You will stake your money. You will face the unblinking gaze of your own accountability -- knowing that every skipped day isn't just a failure, it's a financial forfeiture. This isn't a habit tracker. This is a forge.

### Primary CTA

**FORGE YOUR FIRST CONTRACT**

### Ghost CTA

*...or close this tab and pretend tomorrow will be different.*

---

## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM -- "The Mirror"

Downloaded 14 habit apps. Deleted 14.

Set 47 morning alarms. Snoozed 47.

Told yourself "this time it's different." It wasn't.

You scroll past gym selfies, tasting the staleness of your own inaction.

You start strong -- for a day, a week -- then the iron in your resolve cools, and you just... stop.

You feel the phantom weight of the person you *could* be, mocking the person you are right now.

You promise yourself "tomorrow" -- a word that's become a tombstone for your ambition.

You're tired of being the person who *almost* does it.

**Are you finally ready to forge something real, or will you let this moment melt away like all the others?**

---

## SECTION 3: HOW IT WORKS -- "The Forge Process"

### Three steps. No excuses.

**STEP 1: SIGN A SOUL CONTRACT**

You pick the habit. You set the terms. You sign your name. This isn't a notification you'll swipe away. This is a binding pact with your future self -- written in your own words, sealed with your own money. Break it, and you pay. Literally.

**STEP 2: CONFIRM VIA DAILY EMAIL CLICK**

One click. Every day. No journaling. No selfies. No 20-question check-in. Just did-you-or-didn't-you. One moment of brutal honesty delivered to your inbox. Click "I did it" or face the consequences.

**STEP 3: BUILD STREAKS, RISE IN RANK**

Streaks compound. Ranks climb. From "Spark" to "Inferno" -- your consistency writes your title. Every day you show up, the iron gets harder. Every day you don't, the forge remembers.

---

## SECTION 4: THE DARE -- "Skin in the Game"

### Why free accountability is a lie.

Free things are worthless. You've proven that -- with every "free trial" left to rot, every empty promise whispered to your reflection. Because until something is at stake, nothing is at stake.

Here's a number behavioral scientists don't want you to forget: **losing money hurts 2x more than gaining it feels good.** That's not motivation theory. That's a weapon. And we hand it directly to your future self.

Imagine the moment. You're staring at the contract. Your finger hovers over "Confirm Stake." This isn't tapping "agree" on terms you'll never read. This is a declaration. You're telling yourself -- and meaning it for the first time -- that the excuses die today. The money you stake isn't a fee. It's molten iron poured into the mold of your new identity.

### [COUNTER ANIMATION]

**Right now, ConsistencyForge users have staked:**

# $2,847,391

**...on becoming the people they promised themselves they'd be.**

Your wallet is the most honest accountability partner you'll ever have. It doesn't care about your feelings. It doesn't accept excuses. It doesn't hit snooze.

**So what's it going to be? Stake something real, or keep collecting free apps that collect dust?**

---

## SECTION 5: FEATURES -- "The Arsenal"

### Everything you need. Nothing you don't.

**FLEXIBLE SCHEDULES**
Daily, weekdays, custom. Your contract, your terms. The forge bends to your life -- then holds you to it without mercy.

**ZERO-FRICTION CHECK-INS**
One email. One click. Done. No app to open. No habit journal to fill. No friction between you and your accountability. We eliminated every excuse.

**FINANCIAL STAKES**
Put $5 or $500 on the line. Your choice. Your risk. Your fuel. Feel the weight of your own word pressing down on you every single morning.

**GROUP CONTRACTS**
Forge pacts with friends, teams, or strangers. Shared stakes. Shared accountability. Shared fire. When one person slips, the whole group feels the heat.

**20 RANK THEMES**
Military. Mythological. Elemental. Samurai. Viking. Your streak earns your title. Rise from "Spark" to "Inferno" -- or stall out and wear your failure as a rank.

**14 VISUAL THEMES**
Dark mode. Light mode. Fire mode. Obsidian. Ember. Make the forge yours. Because discipline should look as sharp as it feels.

### Testimonials

> "I used to wake up, grab my phone, and scroll for an hour. I staked $50 on a morning routine contract. Lost $50 the first week. That pissed me off enough to never miss again. 147-day streak and counting. ConsistencyForge didn't motivate me. It made quitting too expensive."
>
> -- **Marcus V., 34, Software Developer** | 147-day streak

> "I was the queen of 'starting Monday.' Downloaded this thing fully expecting to lose money and prove it was a scam. I'm 93 days into a daily workout contract. Down 22 pounds. I've never stuck with anything this long in my life. Turns out I just needed something that refused to let me off the hook."
>
> -- **Priya K., 29, Freelance Designer** | 93-day streak

> "Four of us from work signed a group contract -- daily language learning, 30 minutes minimum. We each staked $200. Nobody wanted to be the one who cost the group. We're on day 64. I can hold a conversation in Portuguese now. The shared accountability is unreal."
>
> -- **David M., 41, Project Manager** | 64-day group streak

## SECTION 7: WORDS -- "The Weight"

### DISCIPLINE
The fire that forges everything.

### STAKES
Where excuses go to die.

### IRON
Bent by heat. Never by weakness.

### UNBREAKABLE
Built one kept promise at a time.

### FORGED
What you become in the fire.

---

## SECTION 8: THE PROMISE -- "The Oath"

> "A promise without consequence is just a wish."

We don't believe in gentle reminders. We believe in contracts.

We don't believe in "trying your best." We believe in showing up or paying up.

We refuse to coddle your excuses. We refuse to let you off easy. We refuse to pretend that another notification will fix what discipline hasn't.

ConsistencyForge exists because the world has enough wish-makers. It needs more promise-keepers.

**This is the forge. Step in, or stay soft.**

## SECTION 10: FAQ -- "Still Hesitating?"

**Is this a scam? What happens to my money?**
Your stake is held in secure escrow. Complete your contract, get it back. Fail, and it's redistributed to users who kept their word. We don't profit from your failure. We profit from a small service fee. Your money goes to people who actually showed up.

**What if I miss a day?**
You lose that day's stake. That's the point. The sting is the teacher. Get back on the horse or watch your money walk away.

**Can I change my contract mid-way?**
No. A contract that bends isn't a contract. It's a suggestion. You chose the terms. Now honor them.

**Is this just another habit app?**
Does your habit app make your palms sweat when you think about skipping? Didn't think so.

**What if I want to quit?**
You can exit early. You forfeit remaining stakes. There are no refunds on broken promises. The forge doesn't negotiate.

**Do I really need to pay to build habits?**
You don't *need* to. You can keep failing for free. But if you're here, reading this far down the page, you already know what "free" has gotten you.

**How is this different from Beeminder or stickK?**
We killed the complexity. No graphs. No goal-setting wizards. No 14-step onboarding. One contract. One daily click. One consequence. Sharp, simple, and designed to cut through your excuses like a blade through soft iron.

## SECTION 11: FINAL CTA

### You've read this far. You know you need this.

You're still here. Probably late at night. Sitting in the quiet hum of your own procrastination, that familiar ache in your gut -- the one that shows up every time you realize you've wasted another day. Another week. Another version of yourself left unforged.

You've read every word on this page because something in you knows: you are done with the cycle. Done with the apps. Done with the promises. Done pretending.

This is your line in the sand. Your moment at the anvil.

### **FORGE YOUR FIRST CONTRACT**

*...or keep pretending tomorrow will be different. It won't.*
