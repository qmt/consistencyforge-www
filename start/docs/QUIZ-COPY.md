> I see you've been dreaming of **{activity}**, but **{excuse}** always gets in the way.
>
> [If Q3 = years or decade:] It's been years. How much longer will you wait?
>
> But here's the truth: **You DO have time.** Today it can be 30 seconds. Tomorrow, 3 minutes. Next week? Maybe 30 minutes — and you'll feel like a new person.
>
> You don't have to do it like you used to, for 3-4 hours. **Consistency beats intensity.** A small step every day. That's all it takes.
>
